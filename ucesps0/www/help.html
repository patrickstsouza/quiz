        <b>Instructions</b>
        <br/><br/>
        The app will show a question depending on your location. The questions are configured using the questions web app and are pinned to a specific geographical location.
        When presented with a question, you will also see 4 alternatives. Choose the alternative you consider correct and press the 'Submit' button.
        The correct answer will be shown to you, and whether you chose the correct answer.
        <br/><br/>
        Clicking 'Done' will automatically ask the server for another question.
        <br/><br/>
        If there are no questions for your location or if you have already answered the questions available for your location, it will show the message 'No question for this location'. Once you move to a location that has a question, it will immediately be shown to you.
